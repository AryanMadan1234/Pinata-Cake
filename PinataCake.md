### Reciepe of Pinata cake
   1. First to make the shell for this Pinata cake,
     we melt the white chocolate till it's completely
    smooth and lump-free. 
    
   2. Then we pour it into the heart-shaped mould and swirl it to make sure that the chocolate covers all the edges and corners of the mould.

   3. When the mould is ready , fill it with chocolates , toffees , cupcakes etc.  And join the two parts of mould .

   4. Keep it in referigerator , and when completely done with it one can decorate it . 


#### Speciality of this cake
    It is popular because of the way of cutting it or  we can say crushing it . 
    As like other cakes it is not being cut by a knife , it is crushed by a hammer . 
    As the hard shell is crushed we can take out toffees , chocolates , cupcakes etc.
     
     This is because it is popular now a days!!!
